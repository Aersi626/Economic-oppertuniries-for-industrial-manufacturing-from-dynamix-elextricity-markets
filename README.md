In this project, I intend to use different machine learning models to predict the electricity price, which can help the market participants reduce their cost for operation. This project used data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). It oversees the operation of California's bulk electric power system, transmission lines, and electricity market generated and transmitted.

Electricity markets are complex decision-making processes that seek to coordinate generation, transmission, and consumption resources at multiple timescales. The following picture shows a simplified version of the actitivies in eletricity markets.
